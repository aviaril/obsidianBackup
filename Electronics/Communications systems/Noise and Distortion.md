Noise - An external random signal added to the original signal 
Distortion - The change of the shape or characteristics of the signal's waveform

Noise come in many forms:
- Crosstalk, when another transmission is picked up 
- Interference, when the wave is changed by other EM waves could be from the mains or lighting 

Noise shows up on a waveform as a wobble in the line, it looks like the line was drawn by someone with a very shaky hand.

## Signal to noise ratio 
Signal to noise ratio (SNR) is just as it says the ratio between the Signal amplitude and the amplitude of the noise. 
Noise can be interpreted as a constant threshold on a waveform, if the amplitude of the signal goes below this noise threshold it will become too noisy to be reasonably used as the SNR is too high. 
In decibels SNR can be calculated as by the formula:
10log<sub>10</sub> (Signal Power/Noise power) or 20log<sub>10</sub>(Signal Voltage/ Noise voltage)
