# Prototype 1
- [ ] Player movement 
	- [x] walking 
	- [ ] jumping 
- [x] collision
- [ ] camera controls 
- [ ] Main island
	- [ ] 'House' with loading zone for interior 
	- [x] small hill on one side with a larger hill on the other 
- [ ] skybox 

### Goals and description
For this prototype I aim to get the absolute fundamentals for my game, those being the collision detection to facilitate the movement, stop the player from walking though walls, the player movement and camera controls to allow the user to interact with the game, and an  for the player to move around 
### Building notes 
#### Camera controls
after moving to the sin cos triangle thing and resetting theta once it reaches 360, now the camera zooms it at first and then spins around the player really fast before the track settles into a spirograph like shape that slowly expands. 
Stopping Theta from increasing and just keeping it at 0 stopped the first issue and the spirograph shape, instead the track was just an expanding circle. 
### Errors
# Prototype2
- Flight system 
- Add return zone below map 
- texture islands 
- second island 
	- rock and scale puzzle 
		- simplified version, just put rock on button instead of a weight system
