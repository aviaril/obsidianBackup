## Abstraction
- taking out unnecessary detail and hiding the complexity from the user.
- are you using cartoony or simple images?
- are you using block colours
- performing complex calculations 
- It is done to save memory ,CPU cycles 

## Inputs, outputs and preconditions 
- Inputs will be from the mouse and keyboard
	- WASD for movement 
	- E to interact 

## Thinking procedurally
- Design prototype 1
	- Movement 
	- camera
	- simple menu
- Build prototype 1
- Design Prototype 2
	- Main menu 
	- Simple map geometry 
	- Lode zones
- Build Prototype 2

## Backtracking 
- The program going back to a previous state 

## Heuristics
- strategies derived from past experiences
- e.g. trail and error, a rule of thumb or an educated guess

## Divide and conquer
- Strategy used by algorithms such as 
## Visualisation 
- Presenting data in a visual way
