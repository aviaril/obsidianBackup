- Used to measure efficiency
	- This is useful to compare different algorithms and implementations 
	- Can be measured in terms of time (How many steps taken to reach the goal) or space 
- Takes best, worst and average cases into account. 

O short for Order

| O(1)     | Constant - The program will always execute in the same number of steps regardless of data size                                                                             |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| O(Log n) | Logarithmic - Execution time increases slower than the rate at which the data set increases. e.g. binary search, most divide and conquer                                   |
| O(n)     | Linear - Execution time increases proportionally to the data set e.g. linear search                                                                                        |
| O(n$^2$) | Polynomial(quadratic) - Execution speed is proportional to the square of the data set, extremely large performance decline. e.g. High numbers of nested loops, bubble sort |
| O(2$^n$) | Exponential - Execution speed increases exponentially with the size of the data set. Very bad. e.g. Recursive calculation of Fibonacci numbers.                            |
| O(n!)    | Factorial - Execution speed increases proportionally with the [[factorial]] of the data set. Extremely slow. e.g. The traveling salesman problem brute forced              |
|          |                                                                                                                                                                            |
|          |                                                                                                                                                                            |
