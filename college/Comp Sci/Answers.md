## exam question 
d. i. Time complexity is the measure of how much time a program/algorithm takes to execute. This is measured in the number of steps taken relative to the size of the data set represented by n. The complexity O(n) is linear meaning that the execution time increases proportionally to the size of the data set. 3/3
ii. Solution A - exponential y
	Solution B - logarithmic y
iii. Dexter should choose Solution B as it will take far less memory compared to solution A. This is because A is exponential so it will take a very large amount of memory compared to the logarithmic solution B as the data set increases in size. 1/3

## Exam question 
i. bollard = new Obstacle(False, 7.8, 8) 2/2
ii. The update procedure distance is an example of encapsulation. 1/2 <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">The attribute distance is private and can only be accessed by update.</span>
iii. Encapsulation makes the code more robust as there is less chance of errors occurring from a class incorrectly changing a variable because the only methods that can access the variable are the getters and setters.  2/2
