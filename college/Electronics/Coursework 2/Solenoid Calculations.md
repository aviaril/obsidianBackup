Goal is to find current needed to drive solenoid based on the assumption that the bolt is a 1cm by 3cm cylinder.
find mass of bolt:
density of steel = 7750 Kg/M$^3$ 
$$
\pi r^2 \times h 
 $$
 $$
 \pi \times \frac{1}{2}^2 \times 3 = 2.35cm^3
$$
$$
 2.35cm^3 = 2.35 \cdot 10^{-6} m^3 \therefore \space 2.35\cdot10^{-6} \times 7750 = 0.0182Kg = 18.2g
$$
