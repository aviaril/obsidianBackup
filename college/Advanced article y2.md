## Breakdown 
### Paragraph 1
- Batteries are useful for many devices 
- VRFBs are useful in certain applications but not others 
### Paragraph 2
-  VRFB is made of two tanks of vanadium electrolytes separated by an electron exchange membrane 
- Li-ion battery is made of 
- Li-ion has high energy density 
- Cells can prioritise energy or power density 
### Paragraph 3 
- Li-ion batteries are compact so good for small devices 
	- Also respond well to changes in power draw 
	- Good energy density, slow charge time
	- Bad for large scale storage 
- VRFBs are better for large scale storage as there is no limit to the tank size 
- Electrolytes are pumped though the cells to charge/discharge 
- as energy capacity increases price decreases 
#### Paragraph 4 
- VRFBs have far better energy capacity than Li-ion and do not lose this overtime 
- Li-ion batteries are installed with and oversized capacity to make up for the loss overtime 
- Li-ion cells can lose 50% of their charge after only 1200 discharges 
### Paragraph 5 
- kWh = 1 kW for 1 hour 
- energy density = $\frac{kWh}{Kg}$ 
- Power density is the measure of how fast the battery can deliver energy $\frac{kW}{Kg}$ 
- Li-ion have good power density but bad energy density 
- VRFBs have excellent energy density and can be designed to have a wide range of power 
- Li-ion are more dangerous than VRFBs as they are far more flammable
