## Starter
1. Fe tank 1, Cr tank 2 
2. Cr$^{2+}$ + Fe$^{3+}$ → Cr$^{3+}$ + Fe$^{2+}$ 
3. The coatings are necessary to prevent the steel from corroding, a suitable coating would be any inert solid. such as a plastic 
4. The membrane allows protons to be exchanges between the two solutions 
5. Platinum? 

## Main Lesson 
- [ ] Bonding and structure 
	- [ ] Draw dot and cross diagram of all molecules in the article where appropriate 
	- [ ] Describe the shape of relevant complexes 
- [ ] REDOX
	- [ ] Determine Oxidation States 
	- VO$^{2+}$ = 2
	- VO$_{2}^{+}$  =1
	- V$^{3+}$ = 3 
	- V$^{2+}$ = 2 
	- V$_2$O$_5$ = -10 
	- 
	- [x] Write and balance half equations for all the reactions 
	- V$^{2+}$ + 2e$^-$ → V
	- Zn$^{2+}$ + 2e$^-$ → Zn
	- V$^{3+}$ + 3e$^-$ → V
	- VO$^{2+}$ + 2H$^+$ + 2e$^-$ → V$^{2+}$ + H$_2$O
	- VO$_2^+$ + 2H$^+$ + 2e$^-$→ VO$^{2+}$ + H$_2$O
	- [x] Categorise these reactions as oxidation or reduction 
	- reduction 
	- reduction 
	- reduction 
	- reduction 
	- reduction 
- [x] Kinetics 
	- [x] Describe Le Chatelier's principle 
	- An equilibrium will change to favour one side of a reversible reaction in response to a change in conditions 
	- If  change is placed upon a closed system at equilibrium the equilibrium will shift in order to minimise that change 
	- [x] Explain how position of equilibrium is affected by change of the concentration, temp and pressure
	- when concentration rises the rate of reaction will increase but the equilibrium will not necessarily change
	- When temperature rises the equilibrium will favour the more endothermic side of the reaction 
	- When the pressure changes the equilibrium will favour the side with less moles of gas
