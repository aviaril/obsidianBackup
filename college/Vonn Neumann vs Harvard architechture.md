## Von Neumann 
- Stores data and instructions in same memory 
- less complex so cheaper to develop for 
- 
## Harvard 
- Stores data and instructions in physically separate memory 
	- this means there are twice as many busses so you can access data and instructions simultaneously
- More complex motherboard is required

- Flash Storage is faster than magnetic 
- Flash storage is more reliable and does not need to be defragged like an HDD#
- light so more portable
- hard to damage by dropping 
- Expensive

- magnetic is cheaper than flash
- Needs to be defragged to stay fast 
- heavy 
- easily damaged due to moving parts 
- slower than HDD 
- Noise 
Flash storage is overall more suitable than magnetic as it is faster than magnetic and does not suffer the drawbacks, such as the fact than an HDD will store the elements on physically separate parts of the disc where it will have to
