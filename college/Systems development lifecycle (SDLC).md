## Stage breakdown 
- Analysis
	- problem identification 
	- investigation 
	- User requirements and success criteria 
	- Test plans 
- Design 
	- diagrams 
	- pseudocode 
	- UI design 
- Build 
- testing
	- Adaptive - it works but you want to improve it
	- Perfective - works as it should 
- implementation
	- direct - introduce full system at once 
	- phased - introduce parts of the system a couple at a time 
	- parallel - running the new system along side the old until you know the new one works, used for safety critical applications 
	- pilot -
	- hybrid


## Waterfall 
- similar to method used in coursework 
- 
1. analysis 
2. design 
3. code
4. testing
5. implementation 
6. maintenance 
- tends to be linear
- should only move to the next stage when preceding stage is reviewed and verified 
- emphasis on documentation at all stages
- lots of time spent at start establishing requirements 

- good for large projects with well established requirements and a large team 
- good for small projects that are well designed from the start 
- bad for projects where requirements are likely to change 

## Rapid application development (RAD)
1. requirements
2. design 
3. implement 
4. test 
5. evaluate 
- iterative 
- evaluation stage would involve showing a prototype to the users and getting feedback 
- can deal with lots of changes as users are involved at every stage 
- user feedback needs to be acted on in next prototype 
- can take long time if requirements keep changing 
- can have poor design due to focus on prototypes 
#### Uses
- good for reasonably large projects where initial requirements may change 
- can take time to produce prototypes and getting feedback 
## Agile / Extreme
- focus on iterative development 
- stages called sprints may not be completed in sequence 
- Daily stand up (scrum) gives feedback to whole team about progress 
- focus on code quality over documentation 
- can include pair programming 
- can change requirements at any point 
- involves lots of user feedback 
### Uses 
- good for when requirements are vague or unknown 
- lots of user involvement 
- Better for smaller project 
## Spiral keep revisiting
- iterative 
- good for system critical systems as there is frequent risk analysis 
- stages 
	1. determine objectives 
	2. identify and manage risk 
	3. develop and test 
	4. plan next iteration 
- large focus on risk at every stage 
- large focus on user feedback 
	- functional prototype 
	- user feedback 
	- add features 
	- repeat 
### Uses
- good for large project 
- good when risk analysis is important 
- when flexibility is needed 
- when requirements are not fully known at the start 

## Exam essay question 
This mobile app is rather likely to have the requirements change, the company may want to show what cinema is showing what films or other features. The fact that this is a mobile application means that there is a heavy
