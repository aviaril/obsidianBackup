The programmer would need to know about HyperText Markup Language (HTML), this is used to create the content of the page such as the text, buttons and links. This is extremely important as the webpage would not exist without this. CSS (Cascading style sheets) is also very important to the webpage as it allows the developer to change the design of the content of the page e.g. the colour of the background and the position of the text and buttons on the screen. Because this website is being sold to another company there will be an emphasis on the perceived quality and the ease of use. Both of these are massively impacted by the design and look of the website which are mainly controlled by CSS. 
Another technology the developer would need to know would be JavaScript. This is a programming language that can be run in browser, this allows for additional functionality beyond linking to another page or a CSS animation. For certain websites such as a calculator or other functional.
