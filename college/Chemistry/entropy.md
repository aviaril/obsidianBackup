Entropy - The level of disorder in a system 
Measured in Joules/Kelvin/mol 
Denoted by a capital S 
Entropy increases as a substance goes from a solid to a liquid to a gas. This is because the molecules have less intermolecular forces holding them together. 
ΔS of water = 188.71 - 69.91 = 118.91 J/K/Mol
ΔS = S$_{products}$ - S$_{reactants}$

feasible - a reaction could happen but it requires some input to start 
spontaneous - a reaction will happen without any input 
all spontaneous reactions are feasible but not vice versa 
Even if the ΔH is positive there may still be a point where the temperature in high enough for the reaction to become feasible 
$$
t= \frac{\Delta H}{\Delta S}
