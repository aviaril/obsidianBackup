If you dip a piece of metal into a solution of that metal e.g. copper into copper sulphate solution, the copper will be oxidised into its positive ion, the ion will move into the solution and the electron will stay in the solid metal. making it more negative. 
$$ Cu^{2+} + 2e^- \rightleftharpoons Cu $$

standard electrode pot - potential difference 

$$Li|Li^+|| Cu^+|Cu $$
$$ Li|Li^+ = Li \to Li + e^-$$
1. Oxidation electrode on the left with components in order of being oxidised 
2. Reduction electrode on the right with the components in order of being reduced 
3. A double line is used to represent the salt bridge 
4. Single lines are used between components in an electrode to represent a phase
