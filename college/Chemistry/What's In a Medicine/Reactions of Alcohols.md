### Physical properties
- Alcohols have a simple covalent structure
- Alcohols have instantaneous - induced dipole attractions, permanent - permanent dipole attractions and hydrogen bonding giving them relatively high melting and boiling points 
- 
### Esterification
1. Alcohol + carboxylic acid
2. Warm with catalyst (concentrated sulfuric acid or concentrated HCl)
3. Add Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> after to neutralise the catalyst
4. Alcohols also esterify with acid anhydrides
- Primary secondary and tertiary alcohols can esterify
### Oxidation 
- Can use an acidified dichromate solution as a catalyst
- Colour change from <span style="color:rgb(255, 149, 0)">Orange</span> to <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Green</span>
- Can only be done to Primary and secondary alcohols
- If a primary alcohol is distilled it will form an aldehyde, if heated under reflux it will form a Carboxylic acid
- 

|     | distillation | reflux          |
| --- | ------------ | --------------- |
| 1st | aldehyde     | Carboxylic acid |
| 2nd | ketone       | ketone          |
| 3rd | n/a          | n/a             |

### Dehydration
- Alcohols are dehydrated to alkenes 
```smiles
C-C([OH]) 
C=C 
[H]-[O]-[H]
```

- Can be done by heating with Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 
- Can also be done by refluxing with concentrated sulfuric acid
- Can be done to primary secondary and tertiary 
### Substitution
- Reactions to make haloalkanes 
- Nucleophilic substitution because halide ions are nucleophiles
