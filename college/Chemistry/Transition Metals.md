## main lesson 
Transition Metals - d-block metals that form one or more stable ions with partially filled d  orbitals 
Scandium and zinc are not transition metals because they do not have 3d sub shells, this means that they cannot have the 

#### shared properties 
- They are all electrically conductive 
- form metallic bonds 
- Form coloured compounds 
- Form complex ions 
- Form one or more stable ions with partially filled d orbitals 
---

d-block elements can form multiple stable ions because there are several stable arrangements of the d and s electrons, Ions which have d5 or d10 are particularly stable. 

### Complex ions 
Complex ion - A metal ion and the surrounding ligands which are bound to it via dative covalent bonds 
Ligand - The group that surrounds the central atom of a complex, negatively charged ions or neutral molecules 
Coordinate bond - 
Coordination number  -
