## Main Lesson 
- Substitution 
- Substitution by similarly sized ligands 
	- Partial substitution 
	- Complete substitution 
	- These reactions take place because of the 
	Substitutions with larger ligands increases entropy and has a positive ΔH 

Multidentate - Bidentate - Monodentate 
The larger ligands are the most stable as more bonds have to be broken and more energy expended to substitute them. 

1. Neither scandium not zinc will form coloured compounds. 
2. white as there are no ligands to break the 3d orbital
