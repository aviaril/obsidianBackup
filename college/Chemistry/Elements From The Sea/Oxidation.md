### Redox Reactions

**Redox Reaction** - any reaction where both Reduction and oxidation take place
Oxidation - Loss of electrons (increase in oxidation state)
Reduction - Gain of electrons (decrease in oxidation state)
- general electron transfers
	- s-block elements (group 1 and 2) typically lose electrons when thy react, this is oxidation
	- p-block elements(groups 5-7) typically gain electrons when they react, this is reduction
	- d-block elements have variable oxidation states
