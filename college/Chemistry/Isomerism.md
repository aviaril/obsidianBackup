Isomer - a molecule with an identical molecular formula to another but with a different structure 
# Structural isomers 
### Carbon Skeleton
```smiles 
CCCC
```
Butane (C$_4$H$_{10}$) is a structural isomer to methylpropane (C$_4$H$_{10}$)
```smiles
CC(C)C
```

### Functional group Placement
```smiles
CCCCO
```
Butan-1-ol (C$_4$H$_{10}$O) is a structural isomer to Butan-2-ol (C$_4$H$_{10}$)
```smiles 
CCC(O)C
```
### Different functional group 
Different functional groups can be made of the same atoms 
```smiles 
CCCCO
```
Butan-1-ol (C$_4$H$_{10}$O) is a structural isomer to ethoxyethane (C$_4$H$_{10}$O)
```smiles
CCOCC
```
# Stereoisomerism - E/Z
stereoisomerism - Same shortened structural formula but different arrangement in space 
- atoms can rotate around single bonds but not double bonds 
- because of this some alkenes can have sterioisomers 
E isomers - Entgegen opposite sides 
sometimes called trans isomers 
```smiles
[Cl]/C=C/[Cl]
```
Z isomers - Zusammen "together", on the same side 
sometimes called cis isomers 
```smiles
[Cl]\CC/[Cl]
```
