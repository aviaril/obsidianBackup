- Used to measure the relative mass of isotopes and find the relative abundance of isotopes in a sample of an element
- Ions are deflected when they pass through a magnetic field, the amount of deflection varies based on the mass/charge ratio of the charged particle

##### Five stages of mass spectrometry

1. Vaporisation - the atoms have to be in gaseous form 
2. Ionisation - atoms are bombarded by a stream of electrons 
3.
