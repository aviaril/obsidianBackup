<span style="color:rgb(21, 28, 60)">[[Developing Fuels]]</span> Hess's Law
The total enthalpy change is Independent of the route taken.

A Hess cycle for the enthalpy of formation has the reactants in the top left corner and the products in the top right with the elements in the reaction at the bottom, the elements and the reactants make up one route going clockwise and the elements and the products making the second route going anti-clockwise.

In contrast a Hess cycle for the enthalpy of combustion has the same arrangement with the elements being replaced by the combustion products (CO2 and H2O) , the Route 1 goes from the reactants to the combustion products
