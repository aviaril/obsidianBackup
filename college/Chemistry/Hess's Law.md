Enthalpy - The measure of a thermodynamic system's internal energy 
1.  Standard enthalpy change of a reaction, $\Delta_rH$, is the enthalpy of change when the reaction occurs in the molar quantities shown in the chemical equation under standard conditions. 
2. Standard enthalpy of change of formation $\Delta_fH$ is the enthalpy of change when 1 mol of a compound is formed from its elements under standard conditions. 
3. Standard enthalpy of change of combustion $\Delta_cH$ is the enthalpy change when one mol of a substance is completely burned in oxygen under standard conditions. 
### Hess's Law 
- The total enthalpy change is independent of the route taken
