1. Structure 1 has a ring of delocalised electrons that increase the stability of the molecule

#### Combustion of benzene 
Benzene is a main component of petrol
C6H6 + 7.5 O2 -> 6 CO2 + 3 H2O
This needs a lot of oxygen for complete combustion, this means it is likely to undergo incomplete combustion producing carbon monoxide 
#### Electrophilic vs Nucleophilic 
Benzene will undergo Electrophilic substitution and addition as it has two rings of delocalised electrons and will not   
### Bromination 
### Chlorination
Need to add diagram from written notes
1. The delocalised electron ring is attracted to the positively charged chloride ion 
2. The electron ring breaks and the chloride ion is bonded to the carbon ring, the bonding electrons of the hydrogen be 

### Alkylation and acylation 
Allows us to add carbons to a benzene ring, this means we can create larger molecules that can do more for us such as aspirin
