Proteins are polymers made up of [[amino acid]] monomer units, and are a condensation polymer. The links between them are called peptide bonds. 


### Primary Structure
The primary protein structure is a linear polypeptide chain, this means that it can 

Glycine is commonly found around the folds in the chain as it is flexible and will fold easily. 

#### Polarity
If the protein is polar it will be hydrophilic as it will readily form hydrogen bonds with water, this will allow it to dissolve in water. 
### Secondary Structure

Secondary structures can either be an Alpha-Helix or a Beta Pleated sheet depending on the amino acids present in the polypeptides. 
#### Alpha-helix 

#### Beta-Pleated Sheet
### Tertiary Structure
A tertiary structure is a group of polypeptide chains folded and twisted over each other, the folding is driven by side chain R groups from the amino acids, this determines the overall function of the group. 
### Quaternary Structure 
Multiple Polypeptide chains called *Subunits* come together to form a functional protein complex,
