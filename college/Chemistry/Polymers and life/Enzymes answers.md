#### Describe and explain the specificity of enzymes 
Enzymes are much more specific as to what substrates they will catalyse, this is because of the they have a precise tertiary structure that exactly matches the structure of the substrate. The active site is three dimensional so stereoisomers will usually not fit in the same enzymes helping biochemists to learn about the shape of the active site. 
#### How does the active site affect the characteristics of the enzyme
##### pH
The active site contains several ionisable groups that will be changed by a rise or fall in pH, changing the shape of the active site meaning the enzyme will not function correctly. 
##### Temperature
Some of the bonds holing the enzyme together are weak id-id bonds that will break easily when the temperature gets too high changing the shape of the active site and thus denaturing the enzyme
##### Competitive inhibition 
Competitive inhibitors are substrates that fit into the active site of an enzyme but are not catalysed by the enzyme, this means they will compete with the target substrate for active sites but will not react once they are there. 


#### Use and action of Captopril
Captopril is a competitive inhibitor of the ACE enzyme, this means it will fit into the active site of ACE bit it will not react once there, this effectively removes the ACE molecule as it now cannot catalyse any of the substate. It is used as a medication for hypertension, congestive heart failure and diabetic kidney disease. 
The ACE inhibitor converts angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 2, a molecule that can cause high blood pressure, because Captopril shares a pharmacophore
