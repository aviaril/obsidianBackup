The N#N bond has a far higher enthalpy than N-N meaning it takes and more energy to break the bond, this is caused by greater electron density in shared area of N#N so larger force of attraction between nucleus and electrons is harder to overcome. This also means the nucleus are attracted closer together resulting in a shorter bond length.

N#N is very stable and has a very low reactivity, it needs a large amount of energy to react. This is caused by the strong electrostatic forces of attraction between the two atoms needing large amounts of energy to overcome. It needs very high temperature to react with oxygen. 


Enthalpy of formation = 1Mol of a substance is formed from its constituent elements under standard states in standard conditions.

every time you add a lone pair bond angle decreases by 2.5 degrees. 

Ammonia will act as a base because it accepts a hydrogen from water forming an HO$^-$ from the remaining atoms in the molecule. 

#### Ammonium 
NH$_4^-$ 
Tetrahedral with 109.5 degree bond angles as there are four atoms bonded to the Nitrogen.
