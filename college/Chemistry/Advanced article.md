Radiation can knock off a hydrogen from waster and form a hydroxyl radial (OH), this reacts at similar speeds to its rate of diffusion  meaning it will react with the first organic molecule in its path. This commonly affects proteins in DNA and is one of the main causes of genetic mutation. 

Radicals can cause chain reactions, these can take place in fatty foods where they cause rancidity and in cell membranes that are mostly made of lipids. 
This is sometimes called lipid peroxidation 

freon, a CFC, is broken down into chlorine radicals and undergoes a radial chain reaction catalysing the breakdown of ozone. The US Environmental Protection Agency says 1 gram of freon can destroy as mush as 70Kg of ozone. 

If radiation strips a second hydrogen from water the next intermediate is hydrogen peroxide, this can bleach things by oxidising organic dyes, by drawing electrons from it. It is a strong oxidiser, this makes it desirable in industry and as a method of killing bacteria. It can both give and receive electrons in a reaction and will do both in some cases, when reacting to itself it forms water and oxygen. 

When in the presence of dissolved iron hydrogen peroxide forms hydroxyl radicals in the Fenton reaction. Hydroxyl radicals can damage almost any organic molecule making the radicals extremely dangerous when inside the body. 

A superoxide radial is far less dangerous than the hydroxyl radicals but will readily give its spare electron to iron, dissolving it from proteins and storage mechanisms. This replenished the amount of iron available to the Fenton reaction forming more hydroxyl radicals.
