## Method 
1. In a fume cupboard dissolve 2.5g of brass in nitric acid 
2. neutralise the solution by adding sodium carbonate dropwise until a ppt forms 
3. transfer solution to to a 250cm$^2$ volumetric flask and make the solution up to 250cm$^3$ with distilled water   
4. add an excess of potassium iodide (10cm$^3$ 0.5 mol)/
5. titrate 25cm$^3$ of the solution with sodium thiosulphate until the solution turns to a dirty straw colour 
6. add ~2cm$^2$ starch to the solution, the iodine will turn blue-black, continue the titration until the solution becomes a milky white  and stays milky white after being swirled s
## Research
Cu + 4H$^+$ + 2NO$_3^-$ → Cu$^{2+}$ + 2NO$_2$ + 2H$_2$O.
Mol of I$_{2}$ = **

The copper in the solution will displace the iodine in the KI freeing iodine to react with starch 
We will be assuming that the screw is made of Alpha brass, an alloy commonly used in brass screws, this has a copper content of 65% and a zinc content of 35%
