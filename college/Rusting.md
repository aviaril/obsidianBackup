### Starter
$$
E = E\degree + \frac{0.059}{n}\log_{10}[ion]
$$
Where n = number of electrons in the half equation 

1. ⠀$Log_{10}(1) = 0 \therefore \frac{0.059}{n}*Log_{10}([ion] = 0) \therefore E=E\degree$

## Corrosion prevention
### Impressed current Cathodic Protection
on
- method of rust prevention 
- A subset of cathodic protection
- only the anode is corroded 
	- This means that we can make the protected structure the cathode and have a sacrificial anode that will be corroded instead 
	- The anode must be made of a material that is more easily corroded than the cathode 
- Done by connecting the positive rail of a DC power supply to the protected metal and the negative to the anode that will be corroded in stead of the cathode

### Galvanisation 
The steel is coated in a layer of zinc, the zinc has a higher e cell value than the steel so is acts as a sacrificial anode and a physical barrier to oxygen 

### ICCP 
Attach the positive rail of a DC power supply to the protected metal making it the cathode, this will stop it from losing electrons and thus corroding. The Negative rail should be attached to a sacrifical anode that will corrode very quickly and will need to be replaced periodically. 

### Barrier Method 
The oxygen is physically blocked from the surface so there is little no the oxygen present for the  reaction to take place. This will prevent corrosion as there will be far less 
- When there is a gap in the barrier there is a low concentration of oxygen touching the iron, this promotes rusting faster than having no barrier at all. 
### Sacrificial Protection 
One material will replenish the electrons lost by another so that the half reaction will be reversed.
- Good protection 
# Practice questions 
1. ⠀
	1. $2H_{2}O + O_{2} +2e^- \leftrightharpoons 2OH^-$
	2. Iron is less likely to rust because it is less likely to lose electrons, this means that there is less $Fe^{2+}$ to react with the hydroxide questions
2. ⠀
	1. The chemist should first dissolve in sulphuric acid and then transfer to a 1dm$^3$ flask and make the solution up to the full 1dm$^3$ 
	2. ⠀
	3. ⠀
		1. $Fe^{2+} + 2OH^- \to Fe(OH)_{2}$ & $ $
		2. Green - $Fe^{2+}$ orange - $Fe^{3+}$
		3. The increased presence of ions means that the charge is easier to carry
