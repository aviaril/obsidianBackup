- Measures the memory used instead of time taken 
- Includes space used by inputs in the program 
- this can be increased by assigning variables, creating data structures or calling/allocating functions 

if no additional memory is allocated compared to the input of a function the complexity would be O(1)
if the same amount of memory is allocated as the data takes up the complexity would be O(n)
