#### Keep in Mind
- #### <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">THE PLOT DOES NOT MATTER</span>
- name may be changed as Goosechase is a company 
#### Computational Thinking
##### Abstraction
- Done to save resources
- Removes details that are not needed
- Represents things in simpler ways e.g. block colours for grass instead of a texture
	1. identify components of a problem
	2. identify components of a solution to a  problem 

thinking logically
1. identify the points in a solution where a decision has to be taken
2. Determine the logical conditions that affect the outcome of a decision
3. Determine how 

thinking concurrently
1. determine parts of a problem that can be tackled at the same time
2. Outline the benefits and trade-offs that might result from concurrent 
Real time processing 

Heuristics
1. Things derived from prior knowledge, think pathfinding
2. 

#### Gameplay
- Light hearted tone, cartoonish shaders and graphics (most likely cell shaded).
- fly to different islands to get clues / witnesses by solving puzzles then fly back to manor to talk to family of victim.
- Manual flapping i.e. press space to flap wings and gain momentum press shift to pull wings in and dive 
	- run from eagles (escape storms?) while flying between islands
	- low poly goose player model (fedora & trench coat?)
	- Floating Islands 
	- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Optional</span> Boid algorithm background NPCs

- Murder Mystery - puzzle (hard)
	- Takes place in manor on floating island, staff live on different islands 
	- Starts at dinner party at manor, player is drunk hence need for tutorial, goes upstairs to bathroom makes mess of corridor upstairs sets up accident leading to the father of the family dying 
	- player sets up accident that looks like murder, ends with player finding themselves guilty
- If items can be brought outside of the secondary island an eagle will swoop down and catch it then bring it back to the nest
#### Puzzles
- Cave Island
	- Lantern puzzle to open door in order to get too box with combi lock on
	- combination lock, order is given by images of objects on the cave wall and the digits are given by the number of those objects in the room.

#### Technical
- Unity
 ###### optimisation
 - use ticks instead of running logic every frame (most likely easier to do from the start)
 - interiors are different maps to the outside

#### Accomplishments/requirements
- Menu 
	- Continue to main game
	- audio settings
	- mappable controls?
	- Credits to assets, make as many as possible get audio online, maybe try music but will most likely outsource
	- resolution?
- Simple physics
- at least three puzzles in different locations
- Animations
