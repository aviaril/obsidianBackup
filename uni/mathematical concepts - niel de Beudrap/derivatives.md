derivative is the ratio of change of f(x) and the change of x 
slope of a line function 
$$
\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}
$$
#### calculating the slope of a line 
$$
f(x)=\frac{3}{2}
$$
$$
\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=
$$
#### ⠀
- easy for line functions 
	- the gradient is the same anywhere on the line 
- any smooth function looks more linear as you zoom in
