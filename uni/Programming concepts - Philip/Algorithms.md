an algorithm needs: 
- a sequence of steps 
- the *Control Flow* - the order to complete the steps 
- a way to stop 
they should be fast and correct 

--- 
Algorithm 
- precise description of how to solve the problem using only basic operations (solution of an algorithmic problem)
- focus on basic operations to make it clear how to implement the algorithm &
- Must halt and must return an answer 
### Specifications 
We state an algorithm using a Specification 
describes valid inputs and the required outputs 
e.g. input : a number n > 0 
output true if n is even, false else 

--- 
### Example 
input: two numbers, n$_{1}$ and n$_2$ 
output: true if n$_1$ > n$_2$ 
#### solution 1
1. check if n$_1$ - n$_2$ > 0 
2. if it is return true 
3. else, return false 
#### solution 2
