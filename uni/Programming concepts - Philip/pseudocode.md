[[language design]]
- human readable not computer readable 
	- coneys intention 
	- syntax varies 
	- has semantics 
		- e.g. C like, Java like 
		- must understand what all the constructs mean 
- language agnostic 
	- easy to implement in any language 
- precise 
	- allows us to analyse complexity 
- in this module it will be based on idealised programming languages
