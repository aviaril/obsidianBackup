### EM spectrum 
#### light 
- 299,792,458 m/s 
- 400-700 nanometres 
	- ourple - red
- 17 cm is one of the bands used by phones 
- often measured in 
	- radiance (W) total amount of energy emitted 
	- Luminance (lumens) - light strength that is perceived by the human eye 
	- Brightness - subjective measure of how bright an object appears to be 
#### Colour vision 
- the retina contains two sorts of light-receptor cells 
	- rods ~ 120 million 
		- detect shades of black and white 
		- in the peripheral vision 
		- work in low light
	- cones 
		- ~ 6-7 million 
		- sensitive to colour 
		- mainly central 
		- only work in bright light 
		- sensitive to 3 general bands of EM radiation 
	- humans have tri-chromatic vision 
		- respond to light in 3 bands - roughly red green and blue 
			- blue peak ~420nm 
			- green peak ~534nm
			- read peak ~ 564nm
			- rods peak ~ 498nm
	- characteristics of cones and rods lead to several 
#### active displays 
#### passive displays - subtractive 
- e.g. printing 
- primary colours cyan magenta yellow 
- these absorb (subtract) red green and blue 
	- c - r
	- m - g 
	- y - b 
### colour gamut 
- specifies the range of colours produced by a display
