[[Objects and Classes]]
- initialise an object 
- store initial values into the fields
- often receive external parameter values from this 

when a constructor is called 
1. an object is crated with appropriate fields 
2. values are passed into the formal parameters (if there are any)
3. the code of the constructor method is executed
