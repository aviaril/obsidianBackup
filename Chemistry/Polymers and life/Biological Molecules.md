# Proteins
18/09/24

Proteins are polymers made up of amino acid monomer units, and are a condensation polymer. The links between them are called peptide bonds. 
##### Name the protein structures
1. Primary - a sequence of amino acids, the sequence determines size and shape 
2. Secondary - an alpha helix, formed because of the hydrogens. Can also be a beta-pleated sheet 
3. Tertiary - a collection of a polypeptide helices folded over each other
4. Quaternary - A collection of polypeptide chains and 
##### Describe the role of intermolecular bonds have on the structures and the properties of the protein. 
1. Secondary structures are held together with hydrogen bonds between the amino groups (-NH) on a peptide link and the carbonyl groups (-C=O) 
2. Tertiary structures are held together in 

### Presentation on Primary protein structure
The Primary protein structure is a group of amino acids linked by a condensation reaction between the amino group and the carboxyl groups of the amino acids called a peptide bond, this forms a polypeptide chain. Primary protein structures make up all of the other structures of protein such as secondary or tertiary.
The sequence of the proteins is conveyed by a sequence of letters that represent the protein, the protein can be represented by either a single or triple letter code.

### DNA
###### Draw the three nucleotides 
They can be represented by a circle for phosphates, a pentagon for pentose sugars and a rectangle for organic bases.

###### Explain how a nucleotide is formed
###### Explain how DNA codes for RNA
One section of DNA is removed(Unzipped) form the other and is used as a template for copying, RNA nucleotides in the nucleus are then joined together in an order decided by the DNA template. Once the section of DNA has been formed the piece taken to be copied can re-join the double helix and the mRNA that was produced can exit the cell nucleus.
