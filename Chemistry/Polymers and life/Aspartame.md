#### Properties
- Methyl ester of dipeptide ASP PHE, meaning that it is formed in a condensation reaction between Aspartic acid and Phenylalanine. 
- 
## Practical 
### Method 
1. Crush aspartame tablets and add to a 50cm$^3$ pear shaped beaker with anti-bumping agents
2. Add 35cm$^3$ of 4mol/dm$^3$ hydrochloric acid and heat under reflux for 30mins 
3. Make up chromatography solvent by shaking together in a separating funnel butan-1-ol. glacial ethanoic acid and water in a ratio of 5:1:4, use the upper, non-aqueous layer.
4. Draw a pencil line 1-2cm form the bottom of the chromatography paper
5. place dots of the refluxed sample in evenly spaced intervals along the baseline and label them 
6. Add 1cm's depth of solvent into a beaker (do not breathe the vapour). The solvent line must be below the baseline on the paper
7. From the paper into a cylinder and place it in the beaker
8. cover the beaker and allow the solvent to move up the paper for 15-25 mins
9. When the solvent is ~1cm from the top of the paper use tongs to remove the paper and place the chromatogram in a fume cupboard and allow the solvent to evaporate 
10. In the fume cupboard spray the chromatogram with ninhydrin solution 
11. warm the chromatogram to fully evaporate the solvent, purple spots should appear
## Questions 

### Question sheet
1. Crushing the tablet 
	1. The tablet is crushed in order to increase the surface area of the Aspartame. 
	2. The anti bumping granules are used prevent the acid from becoming superheated.
	3. If the granules were not used the pear shaped flask could begin to 'jump' as the Hydrochloric acid would boil too violently 
2. Hydrolysing aspartame
	1. Hydrochloric acid is used over other acids because
	2. During hydrolysis the Single bond between the oxygen and the carbon near the benzene ring is broken as well as the peptide bond.
	3. Methanol, Phenylalanine and aspartic acid are the expected products of the hydrolysation of Aspartame.
	4. It is important to control the temperature during reflux to prevent the solution from boiling too violently
	5. If a condenser was not used the acid would simply boil off and very little of the Aspartame would react, this would also fill the room with Hydrochloric acid vapours that are harmful to breath. 
3. Preparing solvent 
	1. Butan-1-ol is chosen as the primary chromatography solvent because it is non-polar, 
	2. The glacial ethanoic acid is added to the mixture to ?
	3. The solvent mixture forms separate layers because the different layers will not dissolve in each other meaning they will be separate in the container, they also have differing densities causing them to form distinct layers. 

## Exam questions 
1. The student would start by dissolving the products in a suitable solvent, the target substance should be very soluble while hot but almost insoluble while cold, then they would dissolve the products in the minimum required volume of hot solvent and quickly filter the solution before it cools down. After this the students should cool the solution and filter out the crystals that form, finally wash these with a small amount of ice cold solvent.
	1. Recrystallisation purifies the product because it removes impurities and other unwanted products, this can be seen when the solution is fast-filtered and residue is left behind. 
2. The student would start by sealing one end of a capillary tube by holing it in a Bunsen flame, they would then
