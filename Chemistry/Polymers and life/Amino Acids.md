An amino acid is a compound that contains an amine group and a Carboxyl Acid Group. 
Amino acids are amphoteric meaning they have both acidic and basic properties.

N-C-C([R])-C([OH])=O

Can be classified as aromatic aliphatic or sulphur-containing 
Zwitterions are ions that have multiple functional groups with opposite electrical charges. 

Carboxylic acid names carbon one when naming. 

#### Key Features
- Hydrophobic because of their polarity 
- Isoelectric point - the PH at which a certain amino acid carries no net electrical charge

#### Condensation reactions of amino acids 
The NH2 group reacts with the -COOH group in a carboxylic acid, a secondary amide group, -CONH is formed and a water molecule is eliminated making it a condensation reaction.
When two amino acids join this way the secondary amide group formed is called a peptide link. A dipeptide is formed, from a dipeptide tripeptides and polypeptides particles can form.


In acid hydrolysis the peptide (amide) bonds in the polypeptide are broken using a strong acid under reflux. The process results in the release of the individual amino acids in the propagated form


In alkali hydrolysis the peptide bonds are broken using a strong base the products will be the individual amino acids but the carboxyl groups will be deprotonated to form carboxylate ions (COO-).
