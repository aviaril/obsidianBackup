Shape depends on the number of pairs of electrons in the outer shell of the atom 
##### Repulsion 
electron pairs repel each other, different types of electron pairs repel each other differently 
- Lone pair / lone pair angles are the biggest 
- Lone pair / Bonding Pair angles are the second biggest 
- Bonding Pair / Bonding Pair angles are the smallest 


#### Methane 
- no lone pairs 
- all bond angles are 109.5°
#### Ammonia 
- one lone pair
- all three bond angles are 107°
#### Water 
- two lone pairs 
- both bond angles are 104.5°

in general each lone pair subtracts 2.5° from the bond angles.
