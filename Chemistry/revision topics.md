### Electron config





### Equations 
C = :TiLambda:F
$E = hf$

##### Q=Mc∆T
Where Q = energy transferred to surroundings 
M = Mass of surroundings 
c = Specific heat capacity 
∆T = change in temperature

hess' law 
#### pV = nRT
Where p = pressure (Pa)
V = volume ($M^3$)
n = number of moles 
R = the gas constant (8.314)
T = temperature (K, Celsius to Kelvin = + 273)
