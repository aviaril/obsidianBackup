Extends approximately 100km above the earth while the radius of Earth is around 6400km.
N<sub>2</sub> makes up around 79% of the atmosphere.
O<sub>2</sub> makes up around 21% of the atmosphere.

Ozone filters out harmful UV rays when in the Stratosphere but will create photochemical smog in the troposphere.

From ground up the layers of the atmosphere are;
##### Troposphere#####
- Around 15km thick 
- contains around 90% of all molecules in the atmosphere
##### Stratosphere#####
- Extends from 15km above sea level to 50km.
- Contains the Ozone Layer ( located between15 and 30km from sea level).
##### Mesosphere
- Located between 50 and 85km above sea level.
- Little information relevant to course.
##### Thermosphere
- Located above the Mesosphere.
- Little information relevant to course.
### History of the Atmosphere
1. Earth's early atmosphere was lost due to upheaval in the solar system
2. CO<sub>2</sub>, Methane and Ammonia released from volcanoes formed a new atmosphere.
3. As the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> increased plant life could evolve, photosynthesis led to oxygen being added to the atmosphere, Initially this oxidised iron and Sulphur in the Earth's crust.
4. Eventually O<sub>2</sub> concentration reached around 10% allowing animal life to begin to evolve.
5. Finally, the oxygen level settled at approximately 21% as the rate of uptake in respiration is balanced by the rate of production by photosynthesis.

Parts Per Million (ppm) is a useful unit to measure low concentrations and is commonly used when talking about certain gasses in the Atmosphere. To convert percentage to ppm one should multiply by 10,000. 
The full method is to multiply by 1x10<sup>6</sup> and then divide by 100, however this is the same as simply multiplying by 10,000.
