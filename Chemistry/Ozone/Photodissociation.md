#### Effects of Radiation
- ==Microwave== radiation increases the *rotational* energy of a molecule.
- ==Infrared== radiation increases the *vibrational* energy of a molecule.
- ==Visible light== and ==UV== radiation increase the *electronic* energy of a molecule, this can mean that it excites electrons to higher energy levels, it can break bonds through photodissociation and it can ionise atoms.

UVA rays do not have enough energy to cause photodissociation in ozone so it passes through the Ozone Layer but it does have enough energy to cause photodissociation in organic compounds such as DNA, this why too much sun exposure can cause skin cancer.
UVB rays also lack the energy needed to cause photodissociation of Ozone meaning they can pass through the Ozone layer, UVB rays typically do not cause cancer but instead cause tans and sunburn.
