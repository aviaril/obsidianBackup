$\text{Rate} = K[A]^2$
1. A + 2B = C = D 
 B is not in the rate equation as it is not involved in the rate determining step 
--- 
Rate equations cannot contain intermediate reactants.  
The rate determining step will always be the slowest. 
In enthalpy change graphs the number of humps corresponds to the number of steps in the reaction, the higher hump takes more energy and is thus the RDS
