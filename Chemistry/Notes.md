# Amino Acids
<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"></span>An amino acid is a compound that contains an amino group (NH2ll) and a Carboxyl Acid Group. 
Amino acids are amphoteric meaning they have both acidic and basic properties.

Can be classified as aromatic aliphatic or sulphur-containing 
Zwitterions are ions that have multiple functional groups with opposite electrical charges. 

Carboxylic acid names carbon one when naming. 

#### Key Features
- Hydrophobic because of their polarity 
- Isoelectric point - the PH at which a certain amino acid carries no net electrical charge 

---
#### Zwitterions
A zwitterion is an overall neutral molecule that has both positive and negative charges in it. An amino acid can exist as a Zwitterion near its isoelectric point (the pH where the overall electric charge on the amino acid is zero, this point changes based on the R group) 

Amino acids can for two ions and a zwitterion, in low pH conditions the amino group will be protonated meaning the nitrogen will be positively charged. 
At the isoelectric point the zwitterion will be formed where the amino group will be protonated and the carboxyl group will be ionised losing the hydrogen and giving the single bonded oxygen a negative charge. 
In conditions more acidic than the isoelectric point it the carboxyl group will lose its proton resulting in the loss of the hydrogen and the single bonded oxygen gaining a negative charge. 
#### Condensation reactions of amino acids 
The NH2 group reacts with the -COOH group in a carboxylic acid, a secondary amide group, -CONH is formed and a water molecule is eliminated making it a condensation reaction.
When two amino acids join this way the secondary amide group formed is called a peptide link.

In acid hydrolysis the peptide (amide) bonds in the polypeptide are broken using a strong acid under reflux. The process results in the release of the individual amino acids in the pronotated form


In alkali hydrolysis the peptide bonds are broken using a strong base the products will be the individual amino acids but the carboxyl groups will be deprotonated to form carboxylate ions (COO-). 


#### Glycine

C(C(=O)O)N
```
- Inhibitory Neurotransmitter in the central nervous system 
- Encoded by all codons beginning with GG
- Acts as a precursor to proteins, in particular collagen which is made up of around 35%  Glycine 
- Has no chain that can be ionised 
#### Aspartic Acid
```smiles
C([C@@H](C(=O)O)N)C(=O)O
```
- Precursor to many amino acids, most importantly methionine, 
- Used in the manufacture of Superabsorbent polymers
- It is a neurotransmitter that stimulates NMDA receptors
- Encoded by the codons GAU and GAC

# Proteins
<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"></span>
Proteins are polymers made up of [[#Amino Acids]] monomer units, and are a condensation polymer. The links between them are called peptide bonds. 


### Primary Structure
The primary protein structure is a linear polypeptide chain, this means that it can 

Glycine is commonly found around the folds in the chain as it is flexible and will fold easily. 

#### Polarity
If the protein is polar it will be hydrophilic as it will readily form hydrogen bonds with water, this will allow it to dissolve in water. 
### Secondary Structure

Secondary structures can either be an Alpha-Helix or a Beta Pleated sheet depending on the amino acids present in the polypeptides. 
#### Alpha-helix 
An alpha helix is a primary protein that has been folded into a helix by the hydrogen bonds between the R groups of the amino acids, these bonds keep the chain in a helical shape
#### Beta-Pleated Sheet
Several primary protein chains in parallel joined by hydrogen bonds between the side chains of the amino acids of each chain. 
### Tertiary Structure
A tertiary structure is a group of polypeptide chains folded and twisted over each other, the folding is driven by side chain R groups from the amino acids, this determines the overall function of the group. 
### Quaternary Structure 
Multiple Polypeptide chains called Subunits along with come together to form a functional protein complex, 

# Paper Chromatography
Paper chromatography can be used to identify amino acids in a mixture 
### Method 
1. Draw a pencil line 1cm form the bottom of the chromatography paper and place spots of the concentrated sample at even points along this line, the spots should be no larger than 5mm in diameter 
2. Place the paper in a beaker with a suitable solvent, the solvent line must be below the pencil baseline or the sample will simply dissolve into the solvent
3. Wait for the solvent to move up the paper and carry the samples with it 
4. When the solvent has almost reached the top of the paper remove the paper form the beaker and mark the where the solvent has reached (the solvent front) with a pencil
5. If needed add an indicator to the paper and mark where the spots are 
6. find the Rf values using the equation distance travelled by spot / distance travelled by solvent front  
# NMR Spectrometry 
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometry is a technique used to find the structure of organic molecules

## Carbon NMR
### Reading
1. Start by counting the number of peaks
