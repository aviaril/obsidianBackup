#### Starter 
1. $K[A]$ | A = 1st order, overall 1st order, S$^{-1}$ 
2. $K[C][H]$ | C = 1st order H = 1st order, overall 1st order,  $dm^3mol^{-1}S^{-1}$
3. $K[S]^2$ | 2nd order | 
## Rate Equations 
$$
\text{rate} = K[R]^{-1}[S]^{0}  \therefore K = \frac{rate}{[R]^1} 
$$
### Arrhenius equation
$$
 k = Ae^{\frac{Ea}{RT}}
$$
A - Frequancy factor 
Ea - activation energy j.mol
R - gas constant 
T - Temperature 
e - eulers number 

---
Example 
A = 5.25
$$

$$
When a catalyst is added the Ea reduces, this in turn reduces the power of e, as this is negative, this means that e will be reduced. This in turn will reduce K. 

As a general rule every 10 degrees increase in temp doubles the rate.

$$
 \ln (K) = \frac{E_{a}}{R} \times \frac{1}{T} 
$$
