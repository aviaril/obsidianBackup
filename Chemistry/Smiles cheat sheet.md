#### Representing Atoms####
Atomic symbols and their corresponding SMILES notations:
C methane (CH4)
N ammonia (NH3)
O water (H2O)
P phosphine (PH3)
S hydrogen sulphide (H2S)
Cl hydrogen chloride (HCl)
Normally hydrogen is not shown.
Elements must be shown in square brackets: \[Au\] elemental gold

#### Representing Bonds####
Single, double, triple, and aromatic bonds are represented by the following symbols:
single – 
triple #
double = 
quadruple $
aromatic :
Normally single bonds and aromatic bonds do not need to be written in the SMILES notation.
Examples showing bonds are:
CC ethane (CH$_3$CH$_3$) C=C ethylene (CH$_2$=CH$_2$)
COC dimethyl ether (CH$_3$OCH$_3$) CCO ethanol (CH$_3$CH$_2$OH)
C=O formaldehyde (CH$_2$O) O=C=O carbon dioxide (CO$_2$)
O=CO formic acid (HCOOH) C#N hydrogen cyanide (HCN)
[H][H] molecular hydrogen (H$_2$)
