#### Representing Atoms####
Atomic symbols and their corresponding SMILES notations:
C methane (CH4)
N ammonia (NH3)
O water (H2O)
P phosphine (PH3)
S hydrogen sulphide (H2S)
Cl hydrogen chloride (HCl)
Normally hydrogen is not shown.
Elements must be shown in square brackets: [Au] elemental gold

#### Representing Bonds####
Single, double, triple, and aromatic bonds are represented by the following symbols:
single – triple # double = aromatic :
Normally single bonds and aromatic bonds do not need to be written in the SMILES notation.
Examples showing bonds are:
CC ethane (CH3CH3) C=C ethylene (CH2=CH2)
COC dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3) CCO ethanol (CH3CH2OH)
C=O formaldehyde (CH2O) O=C=O carbon dioxide (CO2)
O=CO formic acid (HCOOH) C#N hydrogen cyanide (HCN)
[H][H] molecular hydrogen (H2)
