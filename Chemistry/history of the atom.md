### Ancient Greeks 
matter is made of indivisible particles 
### John Dalton - 1808
Atoms are solid spheres, different spheres make up different elements. 
### JJ Thompson - 1897
Plum Pudding model 
 - measurements of charge and mass show that atoms contain negative particles - we call these electrons
 - these negative particles are embedded in a positively charged particle 
### Rutherford - 1909 
- Ernest Rutherford, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden conducted Geiger-Marsden experiment 
- fired alpha particles at gold foil 
- most alpha particles passed straight through with a very small number being deflected backwards (more than 90°)
- this means atoms consist of a small dense positively charged nucleus surrounded by a cloud of negatively  charged electrons 
### Bohr 
- Electrons exist in fixed shells 
 - each shell has fixed energy 
 - electromagnetic radiation is emitted of absorbed when an electron moves between shells, this radiation will have fixed energy
