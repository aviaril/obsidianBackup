### factors
- temperature  - increase in kinetic energy/vibrational energy in molecules of substance so more particles have energy equal to or greater than activation energy 
- catalyst  - Provides an alternate reaction pathway with a lower activation energy 
- concentration  - increase number of particles in same volume 
- pressure - same number of particles in a smaller volume 
- surface area - More particles that can be collided with 
- Intensity of radiation 
### classification of factors
#### Internal
- temperature
- concentration
- surface area 
#### External
- catalyst 
- pressure 
- Intensity of radiation 

| frequency of collisions | both        | energy of collisions   |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Pressure                | Temperature | Catalyst               |
| surface area            |             | Intensity of radiation |
|                         |             |                        |

## Changing factors 
### temperature
positive correlation with rate of reaction in all reactions 
## pressure of gas
increases 

## Measuring rate of reaction 
- collecting gas, gas syringe 
- Colourimetry 
- Temperature change
- PH change
- Cham analysis / titration 


1. Remove small sample called an aliquot 
2. Stop the reaction by quenching 
3. Carry out titration to determine the concentration of one of the reactants or products 


##### Plan an experiment to determine the effect of changing the concentration of hydrochloric acid on the rate of reaction with magnesium

MG + 2HCl → MgCl$_2$ + H$_2$
Because the reaction fives off hydrogen gas you could measure the volume of gas given off to find the rate of reaction. 
### Equipment
- Conical Flask
- Gas Syringe 
- Delivery tube 
- Bung with hole for tube 
- Clamp Stand 
- Stopwatch 

### Method 
- Connect the Delivery tube to the Gas Syringe and the other end to the bung. 
- Add the hydrochloric acid to the conical flask and prepare the stopwatch. Zero the gas Syringe 
- Add the magnesium to the acid and quickly bung the flask. At the same time as you add the magnesium start the stop watch 
- At periodic intervals (5 seconds?) record the volume of gas in the gas syringe and plot a graph. 

### Rate of change
$$
 \text{Rate} = K [A]^m[B]^n
$$
###### 0 order reaction - Concentration has no affect on the rate 

 ###### 1st order reaction - Rate is directly proportional to concentration of A
###### 2nd order reaction - Rate is proportional to the square of the concentration of A

#### Write the overall order of reaction in each case 
 1. 
$$
 rate = K[A]^0 \times [B]^2 = K[B]^2
$$
2. 
$$
rate = K[A]^1 \times [B]^1 
$$
3. $$
rate = K[A]^1
$$
4. $$
rate = K[]
$$
K is measured in $mol^{-1}dm^3s^{-1}$
