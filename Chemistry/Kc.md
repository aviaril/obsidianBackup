- A dynamic equilibrium is the state in a closed system where a forward and reverse reactions are happening at the same rate resulting in an equilibrium 
- When in a closed system the rate of the forward and reverse reaction are the same 

- Le Chatelier's Principle is the concept that changing certain conditions of the environment (such as temperature or pressure) will change the position of the equilibrium 
- The position of the equilibrium will shift to minimise the affect of the change, i.e. if pressure is increased the side with less volume will be favoured. 

- Increasing temp would move equilibrium to the left 
- Decreasing pressure would not change as both sides have one mole of gas. 
- Adding a catalyst does not change the position as both directions of the reaction are catalysed


square brackets denote concentration


$$
aA + bB = cC + dD 
$$
so 
$$ kc = \frac{[C]^c * [D]^d}{[A]^a * [B]^b} $$


when writing equilibrium equations:
2$O_2$ --> \[${O_2}^2$\]
