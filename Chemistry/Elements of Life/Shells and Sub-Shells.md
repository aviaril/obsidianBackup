### Orbitals
An orbital is a 3Dimensional region where up to 2 electrons can exist.
Since they repel each other electrons must have and opposite spin to stay in the same orbital.
#### s Orbitals
S orbitals are spherical and the lowest energy orbital 

#### p Orbitals
- Dumbbell shaped region around the nucleus 
- There are three p orbitals in a p sub-level arranged along the x, y and z axes 
- all orbital sin the same sublevel have equal energy 
#### d Orbitals
