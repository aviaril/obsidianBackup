4. In 1907 Geiger, Marsden and Rutherford conducted the Geiger-Marsden Experiment and concluded that atoms consisted of a dense, positively charges nucleus surrounded by freely orbiting electrons and that the atom was mostly empty 
5. In 1913 Bohr used emission spectra to conclude that; Electrons exist in fixed shells, these shells each have fixed energy, EM radiation id released when electron move between shells and that this radiation has fixed frequencies 
6. in 1932 Chadwick discovers the neutron.
