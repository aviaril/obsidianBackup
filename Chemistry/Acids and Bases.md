#### Acids 
- Release H$^+$ ions when dissolved in water 
- Strong fully disassociate
- weak partially disassociate 
- all organic acids are weak 
- below 7 pH

#### Bases
- Accepts H$^+$ ions - proton acceptors 
- OH$^-$ ions 
- Proton acceptors 
- above 7 pH


##### Strong 
Break up entirely leaving only ions 
HCL → H$^+$ Cl$^-$ 
##### Weak 
leave other things as well as the 

---
HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H$_2$O 
- HCl is the Bronsted-Lowry acid as it give an H$^+$ ion 
- NaOH is the bl base as the OH accepts a proton from HCl

HNO$_3$ + NH$_3$ 

a species that acts as both an acid an a base is called amphoteric. 

| Conjugate Acid | Conjugate Base |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| HCl            | Cl$^-$         |
| HNO$_3$        | NO$_3$$^-$     |
| $H_2SO_4$      | $HSO_4$$^-$    |
|                |                |

Monoprotic acid - an acid that has the ability to donate one proton 
Diprotic acid - an acid that has the ability to donate one proton 
Acidic hydrogen - the hydrogen(s) that disassociate in solution 
$$
pH = -\log_{10}[H^+]

### Strong Bases

$$
K_{w} = \frac{[H^+][OH^-]}{[H_{2}O]}
$$
There is so much water that it can be ignored 
$$
K_{w} = [H^+][OH^-]
$$
$$
 [H^+]=[OH^-] \therefore K_{w} = [H^+]^2
$$
to find teh pH of a strong base 
$$
pH = 14-\log_{10}OH^- this is wrong
$$
