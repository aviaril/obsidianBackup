a) Enthalpy of formation - Energy change when one mol of substance is formed from its constituent elements in standard conditions 
Enthalpy of combustion - Energy change when one mol of a substance is combusted completely with excess oxygen.  


Both atomic radii and strength of the positive charge of the nucleus affect the strength of an ionic bond 

When the atomic radius decreases the lattice enthalpy increases as the atoms are closer together causing stronger forces of attraction. This can be seen in the graph as fluorine has a smaller atomic radius  
Magnesium has a more positive nucleus than chlorine, this can be seen in the ions they form. This means that the negative 
In large ionic lattices there is distortion, this changes a 100% ionic perfectly circular ionic lattice to an ionic lattice with covalent character (ions are not spherical)or a polar covalent lattice(covalent with ionic character )

When an ionic compound dissolves in water the positive dipoles of the water are attracted to the negative chlorine and the negative dipoles are attracted to the Sodium and form bonds. Eventually this force of these dipoles acting on the atoms of the lattice breaks the bond between one of the atoms 
A lattice is soluble If amount of energy given out when the H+ bonds to -ve ion and O- bonds to the positive ion is larger than the attraction between ions. 

Enthalpy of solution - The enthalpy change when one mole of a substance is dissolved in water to infinite dilution. 

Enthalpy of lattice formation - The enthalpy change when one mole of an ionic solid is formed from its constituent gaseous ions.
